# Todoist API (1)

## [section/Developing-with-Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#section/Developing-with-Todoist) Developing with Todoist

Thanks for your interest in developing apps with Todoist. In this section
we will provide an overview of the API we offer and cover some common topics for
application development using them.

You can use our API for free, but depending on your Todoist account plan (or that of the authenticated user), some
features may be restricted.

Please consider subscribing to the [Todoist API mailing\\
list](https://groups.google.com/a/doist.com/g/todoist-api) to get important updates.

## [section/Developing-with-Todoist/Our-API](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#section/Developing-with-Todoist/Our-API) Our API

Our API uses an approach that should be familiar to anyone with experience
calling [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) APIs.

We also have a special endpoint called `/sync`, which is used by our
first-party clients to keep the data updated locally without having to make many
separate requests to the API. Anyone can use it, and some actions will only be
available via `/sync`. The format is unconventional compared to current API standards,
but it is our main driver for first-party apps.

## [section/Developing-with-Todoist/Our-SDKs](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#section/Developing-with-Todoist/Our-SDKs) Our SDKs

Our Python and JavaScript SDKs streamline working with the Todoist API, and
can be installed from the main package registries for each ecosystem.

For instructions, examples, and reference documentation, visit their pages:

- [Todoist Python SDK](https://doist.github.io/todoist-api-python/)
- [Todoist TypeScript SDK](https://doist.github.io/todoist-api-typescript/)

## [section/Developing-with-Todoist/Pagination](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#section/Developing-with-Todoist/Pagination) Pagination

Paginated endpoints are marked by having the `next_cursor` attribute in the response.

When a response comes back with `next_cursor: null`, it means the endpoint is paginated
but there are no more pages to request data from.

If the cursor is `non-null`, there are more objects to return, and a new
request is necessary to get the next page.

The `next_cursor` contains an _opaque_ string that shouldn't be modified in any
way. It should be sent **as-is** in the `cursor` parameter along with the same
parameters used in the previous request.

## [section/Developing-with-Todoist/Integrations](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#section/Developing-with-Todoist/Integrations) Integrations

Integrations can be created and updated [here](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/app-management).

Once done, they can also be submitted for evaluation and inclusion in [our\\
official integrations list](https://www.todoist.com/integrations). This not
only serves as an opportunity to market your integration to our audience, but
will also serve as a way to help users get set up and familiar with your app quickly.

To get your integration evaluated, please submit it via [this\\
page](https://doist.typeform.com/to/Vvq7kNcl?typeform-source=todoist.com/api/v1/docs).

Lost? Reach out to us at [submissions@doist.com](mailto:submissions@doist.com) anytime.

## [tag/Authorization](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Authorization) Authorization

> An authenticated request with authorization header:

```shell
$ curl https://api.todoist.com/api/v1/sync \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567" \
    -d sync_token='*' \
    -d resource_types='["all"]'

```

In order to make authorized calls to the Sync API, your application must provide
an [authorization\\
header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization)
with the appropriate `Bearer $token`. For working through the examples, you can
obtain your personal API token from the [integrations\\
settings](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations) for your account.

To authenticate other users, your application will need to obtain a token from
them using the OAuth protocol. For information on how to obtain a token from our
service using OAuth, please see the [authorization\\
guide](https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#authorization).

For the sake of simplicity the token is not listed on every parameter table but
please note that the **token parameter is required for every resource**.

## [tag/Authorization/OAuth](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Authorization/OAuth) OAuth

OAuth is also available for token generation. It's especially useful for
external applications to obtain a user authorized API token via the OAuth2
protocol. Before getting started, developers need to create their applications
in the [App Management Console](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/app-management)
and configure a valid OAuth2 redirect URL. A registered Todoist application is
assigned a unique `Client ID` and `Client Secret` which are needed for the
OAuth2 flow.

This procedure is comprised of 3 steps.

### Step 1: Authorization request

> An example of the URL to the authorization endpoint:

```shell
https://todoist.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=0123456789abcdef&scope=data:read,data:delete&state=secretstring

```

Redirect users to the authorization URL at the endpoint
`https://todoist.com/oauth/authorize`, with the specified request parameters.

#### Required parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| client\_id | The unique Client ID of the Todoist application that you registered. |
| scope | A comma separated list of permissions that you would like the users to grant to your application. See the below table for detail on the available scopes. |
| state | A unique and unguessable string. It is used to protect you against cross-site request forgery attacks. |

#### Permission scopes

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| task:add | Grants permission to add new tasks (the application cannot read or modify any existing data). |
| data:read | Grants read-only access to application data, including tasks, projects, labels, and filters. |
| data:read\_write | Grants read and write access to application data, including tasks, projects, labels, and filters. This scope includes `task:add` and `data:read` scopes. |
| data:delete | Grants permission to delete application data, including tasks, labels, and filters. |
| project:delete | Grants permission to delete projects. |
| backups:read | Grants permission to list backups bypassing MFA requirements. |

#### Potential errors

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| User Rejected Authorization Request | When the user denies your authorization request, Todoist will redirect the user to the configured redirect URI with the `error` parameter: `http://example.com?error=access_denied`. |
| Redirect URI Not Configured | This JSON error will be returned to the requester (your user's browser) if redirect URI is not configured in the App Management Console. |
| Invalid Application Status | When your application exceeds the maximum token limit or when your application is being suspended due to abuse, Todoist will redirect the user to the configured redirect URI with the `error` parameter: `http://example.com?error=invalid_application_status`. |
| Invalid Scope | When the `scope` parameter is invalid, Todoist will redirect the user to the configured redirect URI with `error` parameter: `http://example.com?error=invalid_scope`. |

### Step 2: Redirection to your application site

When the user grants your authorization request, the user will be redirected to
the redirect URL configured for your application. The redirect request
will come with two query parameters attached: `code` and `state`.

The `code` parameter contains the authorization code that you will use to
exchange for an access token. The `state` parameter should match the `state`
parameter that you supplied in the previous step. If the `state` is unmatched,
your request has been compromised by other parties, and the process should be
aborted.

### Step 3: Token exchange

> An example of exchanging the token:

```shell
$ curl "https://todoist.com/oauth/access_token" \
    -d "client_id=0123456789abcdef" \
    -d "client_secret=secret" \
    -d "code=abcdef" \
    -d "redirect_uri=https://example.com"

```

> On success, Todoist returns HTTP 200 with token in JSON object format:

```json
{
    "access_token": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567",
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}

```

Once you have the authorization `code`, you can exchange it for the access token
by sending a `POST` request to the following endpoint:

`https://todoist.com/oauth/access_token`.

#### Required parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| client\_id | The Client ID of the Todoist application that you registered. |
| client\_secret | The Client Secret of the Todoist application that you registered. |
| code | The code that was sent in the query string to the redirect URL in the previous step. |

#### Potential errors

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bad Authorization Code Error | Occurs when the `code` parameter does not match the code that is given in the redirect request: `{"error": "bad_authorization_code"}` |
| Incorrect Client Credentials Error | Occurs when the `client_id` or `client_secret` parameters are incorrect: `{"error": "incorrect_application_credentials"}` |

## [tag/Authorization/Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Authorization/Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing) Cross Origin Resource Sharing

> CORS headers example:

```shell
$ curl https://api.todoist.com/api/v1/sync \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567" \
    -H "Origin: http://example.com"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: false
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

```

All API endpoints not related to the initial OAuth2 flow support Cross Origin Resource
Sharing (CORS) for requests from any origin. The header
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is set for successfully authenticated requests.

## [tag/Authorization/operation/migrate_personal_token_api_v1_access_tokens_migrate_personal_token_post](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Authorization/operation/migrate_personal_token_api_v1_access_tokens_migrate_personal_token_post) Migrate Personal Token

Tokens obtained via the old email/password authentication method can be
migrated to the new OAuth access token. Migrating your users' personal tokens
will allow users to see your app in their Todoist Settings page and give them
the ability to manage their app authorization.

A successful response has `200 OK` status and `application/json` Content-Type.

##### query Parameters

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| personal\_token<br>required | string (Personal Token) <br>Token obtained from the email/password authentication |

##### Request Body schema: application/json  required

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| client\_id<br>required | string (Client Id) <br>The unique Client ID of the Todoist application that you registered |
| client\_secret<br>required | string (Client Secret) <br>The unique Client Secret of the Todoist application that you registered |
| scope<br>required | string (Scope) <br>Scopes of the OAuth token. Please refer to the [Authorization](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Authorization) guide for the detailed list of available scopes. |

## [tag/Sync](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync) Sync

The Todoist Sync endpoint is specially designed for efficient data sync between
clients (e.g. our mobile apps) and Todoist.

Sync requests should be made in HTTP POST ( `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).
Sync responses, including errors, will be returned in JSON.

The Sync endpoint supports the following features:

- Batching: reading and writing of multiple resources can be done in a single HTTP request. Batch requests help clients reduce the number of network calls needed to sync resources.
- Incremental sync: You only retrieve data that is updated since the last time you performed a sync request.

_Refer to [Request Limits](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Request-limits) to learn more about the number of requests/commands_
_you have for the Sync API_

## [tag/Sync/Overview](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Overview) Overview

## [tag/Sync/Overview/Read-resources](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Overview/Read-resources) Read resources

> Example read resources request:

```shell
$ curl https://api.todoist.com/api/v1/sync \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567" \
    -d sync_token='*' \
    -d resource_types='["all"]'

```

> Example response:

```shell
{
  "completed_info": [ ... ],
  "collaborators": [ ... ],
  "collaborator_states": [ ... ],
  "day_orders": { ... },
  "filters": [ ... ],
  "full_sync": true,
  "items": [ ... ],
  "labels": [ ... ],
  "live_notifications": [ ... ],
  "live_notifications_last_read_id": "0",
  "locations": [ ... ],
  "notes": [ ... ],
  "project_notes": [ ... ],
  "projects": [ ... ],
  "reminders": [ ... ],
  "sections": [ ... ],
  "stats": { ... },
  "settings_notifications": { ... },
  "sync_token": "TnYUZEpuzf2FMA9qzyY3j4xky6dXiYejmSO85S5paZ_a9y1FI85mBbIWZGpW",
  "temp_id_mapping": { ... },
  "user": { ... },
  "user_plan_limits": { ... },
  "user_settings": { ... },
  "workspace_users": { ... }
}

```

To retrieve your user resources, make a Sync API request with the following
parameters:

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sync\_token _String_ | Yes | A special string, used to allow the client to perform incremental sync. Pass `*` to retrieve all active resource data. More details about this below. |
| resource\_types _JSON array of strings_ | Yes | Used to specify what resources to fetch from the server. It should be a JSON-encoded array of strings. Here is a list of available resource types: `labels`, `projects`, `items`, `notes`, `sections`, `filters`, `reminders`, `reminders_location`, `locations`, `user`, `live_notifications`, `collaborators`, `user_settings`, `notification_settings`, `user_plan_limits`, `completed_info`, `stats`, `workspaces`, `workspace_users`. You may use `all` to include all the resource types. Resources can also be excluded by prefixing a `-` prior to the name, for example, `-projects` |

In order to fetch both types of reminders you must include both resource types in your request, for example: `resource_types=["reminders", "reminders_location"]` .

The `workspace_users` resource type will not be returned in full sync, but should be requested in incremental sync to keep data up-to-date once it's loaded from the REST endpoint.

#### Incremental sync

The Sync API allows clients to retrieve only updated resources, and this is done
by using the `sync_token` in your Sync API request.

On your initial sync request, specify `sync_token=*` in your request, and all
the user's active resource data will be returned. The server will also
return a new `sync_token` in the Sync API response.

In your subsequent Sync request, use the `sync_token` that you received from
your previous sync response, and the Todoist API server will return only the
updated resource data.

#### Response

When the request succeeds, an HTTP 200 response will be returned with a JSON
object containing the requested resources and a new `sync_token`.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| sync\_token | A new synchronization token. Used by the client in the next sync request to perform an incremental sync. |
| full\_sync | Whether the response contains all data (a full synchronization) or just the incremental updates since the last sync. |

}

```

To write to your user's Todoist resources, make a Sync API request with the
following parameters:

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| commands _JSON_ | Yes | A JSON array of Command objects. Each command will be processed in the specified order. |

#### Command object

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| type _String_ | The type of the command. |
| args _Object_ | The parameters of the command. |
| uuid _String_ | Command UUID. More details about this below. |
| temp\_id _String_ | Temporary resource ID, Optional. Only specified for commands that create a new resource (e.g. `item_add` command). More details about this below. |

## [tag/Sync/Overview/Command-UUID](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Overview/Command-UUID) Command UUID

Clients should generate a unique string ID for each command and specify it
in the `uuid` field. The Command UUID will be used for two purposes:

1. Command result mapping: Each command's result will be stored in the
`sync_status` field of the response JSON object. The `sync_status` object has
its key mapped to a command's `uuid` and its value containing the result of a
command.
2. Command idempotency: Todoist will not execute a command that has same UUID as
a previously executed command. This will allow clients to safely retry
each command without accidentally performing the action twice.

## [tag/Sync/Overview/Temporary-resource-id](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Overview/Temporary-resource-id) Temporary resource id

> An example that shows how temporary IDs can be used and referenced:

```
[\
    {\
        "type": "project_add",\
        "temp_id": "c7beb07f-b226-4eb1-bf63-30d782b07b1a",\
        "args": {\
            "name": "Shopping List"\
        },\
        "uuid": "ac417051-1cdc-4dc3-b4f8-14526d5bfd16"\
    },\
    {\
        "type": "item_add",\
        "temp_id": "43f7ed23-a038-46b5-b2c9-4abda9097ffa",\
        "args": {\
            "content": "Buy Milk",\
            "project_id": "c7beb07f-b226-4eb1-bf63-30d782b07b1a"\
        },\
        "uuid": "849fff4e-8551-4abb-bd2a-838d092775d7"\
    }\
]

```

> You can see that the `project_add` command specified a `temp_id` property
> ( `c7beb07f-b226-4eb1-bf63-30d782b07b1a`) as placeholder of the actual
> `project_id`. The `item_add` command can reference to this temporary project
> ID. The API will automatically resolve these IDs.

Some commands depend on the result of previous command. For instance, you have a
command sequence: `"project_add"` and `"item_add"` which first creates a project
and then add a new task to the newly created project. In order to run the later
`item_add` command, we need to obtain the project ID returned from the previous
command. Therefore, the normal approach would be to run these two commands in
two separate HTTP requests.

The temporary resource ID feature allows you to run two or more dependent
commands in a single HTTP request. For commands that are related to creation of
resources (i.e. `item_add`, `project_add`), you can specify an extra `temp_id`
as a placeholder for the actual ID of the resource. The other commands in the
same sequence could directly refer to `temp_id` if needed.

## [tag/Sync/Overview/Response-Error](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Overview/Response-Error) Response / Error

> An example of a single request sync return value:

```
{
    "sync_status": { "863aca2c-65b4-480a-90ae-af160129abbd": "ok" }
}

```

> An example of a multiple requests sync return value:

```
{
    "sync_status": {
        "32eaa699-e9d7-47ed-91ea-e58d475791f1": "ok",
        "bec5b356-3cc1-462a-9887-fe145e3e1ebf": {
            "error_code": 15,
            "error": "Invalid temporary id"
        }
    }
}

```

The result of command executions will be stored in the following response JSON
object field:

| Data | Description |
| --- | --- |
| temp\_id\_mapping _Object_ | A dictionary object that maps temporary resource IDs to real resource IDs. |
| sync\_status _Object_ | A dictionary object containing result of each command execution. The key will be the command's `uuid` field and the value will be the result status of the command execution. |

The status result of each command execution is in the `sync_status` dictionary
object. The key is a command `uuid` and the value will be the result status of
the command execution.

There are two possible values for each command status:

- An "ok" string which signals success of the command
- An error object containing error information of a command.

Please see the adjacent code examples for the possible format of the
`sync_status`.

## [tag/Sync/Overview/Response-status-codes](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Overview/Response-status-codes) Response status codes

The server uses the HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a
request. As is customary in web servers, a 2xx code indicates - success, a
4xx code - an error due to incorrect user provided information, and a 5xx code -
an internal, possibly temporary, error.

| Status code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 OK | The request was processed successfully. |
| 400 Bad Request | The request was incorrect. |
| 401 Unauthorized | Authentication is required, and has failed, or has not yet been provided. |
| 403 Forbidden | The request was valid, but for something that is forbidden. |
| 404 Not Found | The requested resource could not be found. |
| 429 Too Many Requests | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. |
| 500 Internal Server Error | The request failed due to a server error. |
| 503 Service Unavailable | The server is currently unable to handle the request. |

When working with the Sync API, changes can be **batched** into one commit.
In our example, we're batching the creation of a 'Shopping List' project with three
different items.

As we've committed the changes all at once, we’re significantly reducing the amount of
network calls that have to be made, as well as ensuring we’re not running into any rate
limiting issues.

## [tag/Sync/Workspace-users](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Workspace-users) Workspace users

**`workspace_users` are not returned in full sync responses, only in incremental sync**. To keep a list of workspace users up-to-date, clients should first [list all workspace users](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Workspace/operation/get_workspaces_users_api_v1_workspaces_users_get), then use incremental sync to update that initial list as needed.

`workspace_users` are not the same as collaborators. Two users can be members of a common workspace without having a common shared project, so they will both “see” each other in `workspace_users` but not in collaborators.

Guests will not receive `workspace_users` sync events or resources.

| timezone _String_ | The timezone of the user. |
| image\_id _String_ | The ID of the user's avatar. |
| role _String_ | The role of the user in this workspace. Possible values are: ADMIN, MEMBER, GUEST. A guest is someone who is a collaborator of a workspace project, without being an actual member of the workspace. |
| avatar\_big _String_ | The link to a 195x195 pixels image of the user's avatar. |
| avatar\_medium _String_ | The link to a 60x60 pixels image of the user's avatar. |

## [tag/Sync/Sharing](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Sharing) Sharing

Projects can be shared with other users, which are then referred to as collaborators.
This section describes the different commands that are related to sharing.

## [tag/Sync/Sharing/Collaborators](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Sharing/Collaborators) Collaborators

> An example collaborator object:

```
{
    "id": "2671362",
    "email": "you@example.com",
    "full_name": "Example User",
    "timezone": "GMT +3:00",
    "image_id": null
}

```

There are two types of objects to get information about a user’s collaborators,
and their participation in shared projects: `collaborators` and
`collaborator_states`

Every user who shares at least one project with another user, has a
collaborators record in the API response. The record contains a restricted
subset of user-specific properties.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| id _String_ | The user ID of the collaborator. |
| email _String_ | The email of the collaborator. |
| full\_name _String_ | The full name of the collaborator. |
| timezone _String_ | The timezone of the collaborator. |
| image\_id _String_ | The image ID for the collaborator's avatar, which can be used to get an avatar from a specific URL. Specifically the `https://dcff1xvirvpfp.cloudfront.net/<image_id>_big.jpg` can be used for a big ( `195x195` pixels) avatar, `https://dcff1xvirvpfp.cloudfront.net/<image_id>_medium.jpg` for a medium ( `60x60` pixels) avatar, and `https://dcff1xvirvpfp.cloudfront.net/<image_id>_small.jpg` for a small ( `35x35` pixels) avatar. |

Partial sync returns updated collaborator objects for users that have changed
their attributes, such as their name or email.

## [tag/Sync/Sharing/Collaborator-states](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Sharing/Collaborator-states) Collaborator states

> An example collaborator state:

```
{
    "project_id": "6H2c63wj7x9hFJfX",
    "user_id": "2671362",
    "state": "active",
    "is_deleted": false,
    "role": "READ_WRITE",
}

```

The list of collaborators don’t contain any information on how users are
connected to shared projects. To provide information about these connections,
the `collaborator_states` field should be used. Every collaborator state record
is a mere "user to shared project" mapping.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| project\_id _String_ | The shared project ID of the user. |
| user\_id _String_ | The user ID of the collaborator. |
| state _String_ | The status of the collaborator state, either `active` or `invited`. |
| is\_deleted _Boolean_ | Set to `true` when the collaborator leaves the shared project. |
| role | The role of the collaborator in the project. _Only available for teams_ |

    {\
        "type": "share_project",\
        "temp_id": "854be9cd-965f-4ddd-a07e-6a1d4a6e6f7a",\
        "uuid": "fe6637e3-03ce-4236-a202-8b28de2c8372",\
        "args": {\
            "project_id": "6H2c63wj7x9hFJfX",\
            "email": "you@example.com"\
        }\
    }]'

```

> Example response:

```shell

  ...
  "sync_status": {"fe6637e3-03ce-4236-a202-8b28de2c8372": "ok"},
  ...
}

```

_When sharing a teams project_

Workspace projects with `is_invite_only` set to true can only be shared by
workspace admins, or by project members with `ADMIN` or `CREATOR` role. Other
users will get a “forbidden” error. The role for the new collaborator cannot be
greater than the role of the person sharing the project.

Moves a personal project into the target workspace.

A few notes about moving projects to a workspace:

- Moving a parent project to a workspace will also move all its child projects to that workspace.
- If no folder\_id is supplied, child projects will be moved into a folder with the same name as the parent project being moved
- If a folder\_id is supplied, the parent and child projects will be moved into that folder.
- At the moment, it is not possible to move a project to another workspace (changing its `workspace_id`), or to the user's personal workspace.
- Moving a project to a workspace affects all its collaborators. Collaborators who are not members of the target workspace will be added as guests, if guest members are allowed in the target workspace

## [tag/Sync/Comments/File-Attachments](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Comments/File-Attachments) File Attachments

A file attachment is represented as a JSON object. The file attachment may point
to a document previously uploaded by the `uploads/add` API call, or by any
external resource.

#### Base file properties

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| file\_name _String_ | The name of the file. |
| file\_size _Integer_ | The size of the file in bytes. |
| file\_type _String_ | MIME type (for example `text/plain` or `image/png`). |
| file\_url _String_ | The URL where the file is located. Note that we don't cache the remote content on our servers and stream or expose files directly from third party resources. In particular this means that you should avoid providing links to non-encrypted (plain HTTP) resources, as exposing this files in Todoist may issue a browser warning. |
| upload\_state _String_ | Upload completion state (for example `pending` or `completed`). |

#### Image file properties

If you upload an image, you may provide thumbnail paths to ensure Todoist
handles them appropriately. Valid thumbnail information is a JSON array with
URL, width in pixels, height in pixels. Ex.:
\[" [https://example.com/img.jpg",400,300\]](https://example.com/img.jpg%22,400,300%5D). "Canonical" thumbnails (ones we create
by `uploads/add` API call) have the following sizes: `96x96`, `288x288`,
`528x528`.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| tn\_l _List_ | Large thumbnail (a list that contains the URL, the width and the height of the thumbnail). |
| tn\_m _List_ | Medium thumbnail (a list that contains the URL, the width and the height of the thumbnail). |
| tn\_s _List_ | Small thumbnail (a list that contains the URL, the width and the height of the thumbnail). |

#### Audio file properties

If you upload an audio file, you may provide an extra attribute `file_duration`
(duration of the audio file in seconds, which takes an integer value). In the
web interface the file is rendered with a `<audio>` tag, so you should make sure
it's supported in current web browsers. See
[supported media formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats) for
the reference.

## [tag/Sync/Labels](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Labels) Labels

> An example personal label object:

```
{
    "id": "2156154810",
    "name": "Food",
    "color": "lime_green",
    "item_order": 0,
    "is_deleted": false,
    "is_favorite": false
}

```

There are two types of labels that can be added to Todoist tasks.
We refer to these as `personal` and `shared` labels.

#### Personal labels

Labels created by the current user will show up in their personal label list.
These labels can be customized and will stay in their account unless deleted.

A personal label can be converted to a shared label by the user if they no longer
require them to be stored against their account, but they still appear on
shared tasks.

#### Shared labels

A label created by a collaborator that doesn't share a name with an existing personal label
will appear in our clients as a shared label. These labels are gray by default and will
only stay in the shared labels list if there are any active tasks with this label.

A user can convert a shared label to a personal label at any time. The label will then become
customizable and will remain in the account even if not assigned to any active tasks.

Shared labels do not appear in the sync response for a user's account. They only appear
within the `labels` list of the [tasks](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Sync/Tasks) that they are assigned to.

You can find more information on the differences between personal and shared labels in our [Help Center](https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-labels-dSo2eE#shared).

  ...
  "sync_status": {"c5888360-96b1-46be-aaac-b49b1135feab": "ok"},
  ...
}

```

Complete a recurring task. The reason why this is a special case is because
we need to mark a recurring completion (and using `item_update` won't do
this). See also `item_close` for a simplified version of the command.

#### Command arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id _String_ | Yes | The ID of the item to update (a number or a temp id). |
| due _Object_ | No | The due date of the task. See the [Due dates](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Due-dates) section for more details. |
| is\_forward _Boolean_ | No | Set this argument to 1 for completion, or 0 for uncompletion (e.g., via undo). By default, this argument is set to 1 (completion). |
| reset\_subtasks _Boolean_ | No | Set this property to 1 to reset subtasks when a recurring task is completed. By default, this property is not set (0), and subtasks will retain their existing status when the parent task recurs. |

## [tag/Sync/Tasks/Close-task](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Sync/Tasks/Close-task) Close task

> Example close task request:

```shell

        "type": "item_close",\
        "uuid": "c5888360-96b1-46be-aaac-b49b1135feab",\
        "args": {"id": "2995104339"}\
    }]'

```

> Example response:

```shell
{
  ...
  "sync_status": {"c5888360-96b1-46be-aaac-b49b1135feab": "ok"},
  ...
}

```

A simplified version of `item_complete` / `item_update_date_complete`. The command
does exactly what official clients do when you close a task: regular tasks are
completed and moved to the archive, recurring tasks are scheduled to their next occurrence.

#### Command arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id _String_ | Yes | The ID of the item to close (a number or a temp id). |

## [tag/Due-dates](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Due-dates) Due dates

Due dates for tasks and reminders is one of the core concepts of Todoist. It's
very powerful and quite complex, because it has to embrace different use-cases
of Todoist users.

Todoist supports three types of due dates.

- Full-day dates (like "1 January 2018" or "tomorrow")
- Floating due dates with time (like "1 January 2018 at 12:00" or "tomorrow
at 10am")
- Due dates with time and fixed timezone (like "1 January 2018 at 12:00
America/Chicago" or "tomorrow at 10am Asia/Jakarta")

Unless specified explicitly, dates with time are created as floating.

In addition, any of these due dates can be set to recurring or not, depending
on the date string, provided by the client.

Our Help Center contains an in-depth article about the difference between
[floating due dates and dates with fixed zones](https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/set-a-fixed-time-or-floating-time-for-a-task-YUYVp27q).

You can also find more information about
[recurring due dates](https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-recurring-due-dates-YUYVJJAV) in our Help Center.

## [tag/Due-dates/Create-or-update-due-dates](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Due-dates/Create-or-update-due-dates) Create or update due dates

Usually you create due dates when you create a new task or a reminder, or
you want to update a due date for an object. In both cases due date is provided
as a `due` attribute of an object. You may provide all fields of an object in
the constructor, but it's more convenient to provide only a subset of the
fields and let the server fill the gaps.

#### Create or update due date from user-provided string

> Input example

```json
"due": {"string":  "tomorrow"}

```

> Output example. Full-date instance is created.

```json
"due": {
    "date": "2018-11-15",
    "timezone": null,
    "is_recurring": false,
    "string": "tomorrow",
    "lang": "en"
}

```

> Input example

```json
"due": {"string":  "tomorrow at 12"}

```

> Output example. Floating due date created

```json
"due": {
    "date": "2018-11-15T12:00:00.000000",
    "timezone": null,
    "is_recurring": false,
    "string": "tomorrow at 12",
    "lang": "en"
}

```

> Input example. Timezone is set explicitly

```json
"due": {"string": "tomorrow at 12", "timezone": "Asia/Jakarta"}

```

> Output example. Due date with fixed timezone created

```json
"due": {
    "date": "2018-11-16T05:00:00.000000Z",
    "timezone": "Asia/Jakarta",
    "is_recurring": false,
    "string": "tomorrow at 12",
    "lang": "en"
}

```

You can ask the user to provide a due string and to create a new object from that.
You need to provide a timezone if you want to create a fixed due date instead
of a floating one. If you want to create a task without a due date, you
can set the due attribute to `null`.

See the code section to the right for more examples. In all cases you can set
the `lang` attribute of the date to set the language of the input. If the language
is not set, the language from user settings will be used.

#### Create or update due date from a date object

> Input example for a full-day event

```json
"due": {"date": "2018-10-14"}

```

For a full-day event the format of the date attribute is `YYYY-MM-DD`.

> Output example

```json
"due": {
    "date": "2018-10-14",
    "timezone": null,
    "is_recurring": false,
    "string": "2018-10-14",
    "lang": "en"
}

```

> Input example for a floating due date

```json
"due": {"date": "2018-10-14T10:00:00.000000"}

```

> Output example

```json
"due": {
    "date": "2018-10-14T10:00:00.000000",
    "timezone": null,
    "is_recurring": false,
    "string": "2018-10-14 10:00",
    "lang": "en"
}

```

In some cases you have a date object and want to create a due date from it.
Usually all you need to do is choose the format of the due date (floating
or fixed) and format the time object properly with strftime or alternative for
your programming language. The formatted string goes to a "date" attribute of
the constructor.

Note that this approach does not allow you to create recurring due dates.

For a floating due date event the format of the date attribute is
`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` and the date has to be provided in user's local
timezone.

> Input example for a due date with a fixed timezone

```json
"due": {"date": "2018-10-14T05:00:00.000000Z"}

```

> Output example

```json
"due": {
    "date": "2018-10-14T05:00:00.000000Z",
    "timezone": "Asia/Jakarta",
    "is_recurring": false,
    "string": "2018-10-14 12:00",
    "lang": "en"
}

```

For a fixed due date event the format of the date attribute is
`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` (note the "Z" ending) and the date has to be provided
in UTC. Optionally you can provide a timezone name to overwrite the default
timezone of the user.

## [tag/Deadlines](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Deadlines) Deadlines

Similar to due dates, deadlines can be set on tasks, and can be used to differentiate
between when a task should be started, and when it must be done by.

Unlike due dates, deadlines only support non-recurring dates with no time component.

You can find our more information about
[deadlines](https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-deadlines-uMqbSLM6U) in
our Help Center.

## [tag/Deadlines/Example-deadline-object](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Deadlines/Example-deadline-object) Example deadline object

```json
{
    "date": "2016-12-01",
    "lang": "en"
}

```

#### Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| date _string_ | Deadline in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD` ( [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)). |
| lang _string_ | Lang which has to be used to parse the content of the string attribute. Used by clients and on the server side to properly process deadlines. Valid languages are: `en`, `da`, `pl`, `zh`, `ko`, `de`, `pt`, `ja`, `it`, `fr`, `sv`, `ru`, `es`, `nl`, `fi`, `nb`, `tw`. |

## [tag/Deadlines/Create-or-update-deadlines](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Deadlines/Create-or-update-deadlines) Create or update deadlines

Usually you create deadlines when you create a new task, or you want to update a
deadline for an object. In both cases due date is provided as a `deadline` attribute of
an object.

#### Create or update deadline

> Input example

```json
"deadline": {"date":  "2024-01-25", "lang": "en"}

```

> Output example

```json
"deadline": {
    "date": "2024-01-25",

## [tag/Activity](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Activity) Activity

_Availability of the activity log and the duration of event storage are_
_dependent on the current user plan. These values are indicated by the_
_`activity_log` and `activity_log_limit` properties of the [user plan\_\
_limits](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Sync/User/User-plan-limits) object._

The activity log makes it easy to see everything that is happening across projects, items and notes.

### Logged events

Currently the official Todoist clients present only the most important events
that most users may be interested in.
There are further types of events related to projects, items and notes that are
stored in our database, and can be accessed through the API.

The following events are logged for items:

- Items added
- Items updated (only changes to `content`, `description`, `due_date` and `responsible_uid`)
- Items deleted
- Items completed
- Items uncompleted

The following events are logged for notes:

- Notes added
- Notes updated (only changes to `content` or `file_name` if the former is empty)
- Notes deleted

The following events are logged for projects:

- Projects added
- Projects updated (only changes to `name`)
- Projects deleted
- Projects archived
- Projects unarchived
- Projects shared
- Projects left

### Pagination details

There are 3 parameters that control which events are returned from the activity
log. These parameters should be used in combination to get all the events one
is interested in.

#### The `page` parameter

The events in the activity log are organized by week. Each week starts at
Sunday `12:00:00` (PM or noon), and ends the next Sunday at `11:59:59`, This
means that one can target a specific week, and get events from that week. The
`page` parameter specifies from which week to fetch events, and it does so in a
way that is relative to the current time.

This will be more easy to understand with the following example. Assuming it's
now `Wednesday, February 23`, then:

- `page=0`: Denotes events from the current week, that is from `Sunday, February 20`, to just now
- `page=1`: Denotes events from last week, from `February 13`, to `February 20`
- `page=2`: Denotes events from 2 weeks ago, from `February 6`, to `February 13`
- `page=3`: Denotes events from 3 weeks ago, from `January 30`, to `February 6`

And so on.

If the `page` parameter is not specified, then events from the current and last
week are returned. This is equivalent to getting events for `page=0` and
`page=1` together. So omitting the `page` parameter, and depending on which day
of the week the call is made, this should return events from `7` to `14` days
ago. This is useful in order to always fetch at least a week's events, even on
Mondays.

In the above example, this would return events from `Sunday, February 13` to
`Wednesday, February 23`, so around `10` days.

#### The `limit` and `offset` parameters

Each week can have a lot of events. This is where the `limit` and `offset`
parameters come into play. Because it's not resource friendly to get hundreds
of events in one call, the events returned are limited by the default value of
the `limit` parameter, as defined above in the [Properties](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Activity)
section. This limit can be increased, but up to a maximum value, again defined
in the [Properties](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Activity) section.

Since not all of the events of a specific week, can be returned in a single
call, a subsequent call should use the `offset` parameter, in order to skip the
events already received.

As an example, assuming that the current week (ie. `page=0`) has `78` events,
and that a `limit=50` is used in order to get up to `50` events in each call,
one would need to do 2 calls:

1. A request with parameters `page=0`, `limit=50`, and `offset=0`, will return `50` events and also the `count=78` value
2. Since the return value `count=78` is larger than `limit=50`, an additional call is needed with the parameters `page=0`, `limit=50`, and `offset=50`, which will return the rest of the `28` events

If last week had `234` events, and assuming a `limit=100` was used:

1. A request with `page=1`, `limit=100` and `offset=0`, will return `100` events, and `count=234`
2. A second request with `page=1`, `limit=100` and `offset=100`, will return additional `100` events

## [tag/Webhooks](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Webhooks) Webhooks

The Todoist Webhooks API allows applications to receive real-time notification
(in the form of HTTP POST payload) on the subscribed user events. Notice that
once you have a webhook setup, you will start receiving webhook events from
**all your app users** immediately.

#### Important Considerations

Due to the nature of network requests, your application should assume webhook
requests could arrive out of order or could even fail to arrive; webhooks should
be used only as notifications and not as a primary Todoist data source (make
sure your application could still work when webhook is not available).

#### Webhook Activation & Personal Use

The webhook for a specific user is activated when that user completes the [OAuth flow](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Authorization/OAuth) of the app that declares the webhook.

**Todoist webhooks don't fire by default for the user that has created the Todoist app, which is frequently the desired state for the personal use of webhooks.**

To activate webhooks for personal use, you need to complete the OAuth process with your account. You can do this without code by manually executing the OAuth flow in two steps.

1. Performing the [authorization request](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Authorization/OAuth) in the browser and capturing the `code` via the browser's developer tools.
2. Performing the [token exchange request](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Authorization/OAuth) through a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and reading the `access_token` from the response. _Note that you can't make this request via the browser as it needs to be a POST request._

## [tag/Webhooks/Configuration](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Webhooks/Configuration) Configuration

Before you can start receiving webhook event notifications, you must first have
your webhook configured at the App Management Console.

#### Events

Here is a list of events that you could subscribe to, and they are configured at
the [App Management Console](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/app-management).

| Event Name | Description | Event Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| item:added | A task was added | The new [Task](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Sync/Tasks). |

| reminder:fired | A reminder has fired | The [Reminder](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#/tag/Sync/Reminders) that fired. |

#### Events Extra

Some events can include extra meta information in the `event_data_extra` field. These can be useful, for example, if you need to distinguish between item updates that are postponed and initiated by the user and item updates that are task completions (initiated by completing a recurring task)

| Event Name | Description | Event Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| item:updated | For events issued by the user directly these include `old_item` and `update_intent` | `old_item` will be an [Task](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Sync/Tasks), and `update_intent` can be `item_updated`, `item_completed`, `item_uncompleted`. |

```

Each webhook event notification request contains a JSON object. The event JSON
contains the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| event\_name _String_ | The event name for the webhook, see the table in the [Configuration](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Webhooks/Configuration) section for the list of supported events. |
| user\_id _String_ | The ID of the user that is the destination for the event. |
| event\_data _Object_ | An object representing the modified entity that triggered the event, see the table in the [Configuration](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Webhooks/Configuration) section for details of the `event_data` for each event. |
| version _String_ | The version number of the webhook configured in the [App Management Console](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/app-management). |
| initiator _Object_ | A [Collaborator](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#collaborators) object representing the user that triggered the event. This may be the same user indicated in `user_id` or a collaborator from a shared project. |
| triggered\_at _String_ | The date and time when the event was triggered. |
| event\_data\_extra _Object_ | Optional object that can include meta information, see the table in the [Configuration](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Webhooks/Configuration) section for details of the `event_data_extra` for each event. |

#### Request Header

| Header Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| User-Agent | Will be set to "Todoist-Webhooks" |
| X-Todoist-Hmac-SHA256 | To verify each webhook request was indeed sent by Todoist, an `X-Todoist-Hmac-SHA256` header is included; it is a SHA256 Hmac generated using your `client_secret` as the encryption key and the whole request payload as the message to be encrypted. The resulting Hmac would be encoded in a base64 string. |
| X-Todoist-Delivery-ID | Each webhook event notification has a unique `X-Todoist-Delivery-ID`. When a notification request failed to be delivered to your endpoint, the request would be re-delivered with the same `X-Todoist-Delivery-ID`. |

#### Failed Delivery

When an event notification fails to be delivered to your webhook callback URL
(i.e. due to server / network error, incorrect response, etc),
it will be reattempted after 15 minutes. Each notification will be
reattempted for at most three times.

**Your callback endpoint must respond with an HTTP 200 when receiving an event**
**notification request.**

A response other than HTTP 200 will be considered as a failed delivery, and the
notification will be attempted again.

## [tag/Request-limits](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Request-limits) Request limits

### Payload Size

There is a 1MiB HTTP request body limit on POST requests.

The maximum payload size for an [attachment upload](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#uploads) is dependent on the current user plan.
This value is indicated by the `upload_limit_mb` property of the [user plan limits](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#user-plan-limits) object.

### Header Size

Total size of HTTP headers cannot exceed 65 KiB.

### Processing Timeouts

There are processing timeouts associated with each endpoint, and these vary
depending on the type of action being performed.

| Type | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Uploads | 5 minutes |
| Standard Request | 15 seconds |

### Rate Limiting

Limits are applied differently for full and partial syncs. You should ideally only make a full sync on your initial request and then subsequently perform incremental syncs as this is faster and more efficient.

See the sync section for further information on [incremental sync](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#read-resources).

For each user, you can make a maximum of 1000 partial sync requests within a 15 minute period.

For each user, you can make a maximum of 100 full sync requests within a 15 minute period.

You can reduce the number of requests you make by batching up to 100 commands in each request and it will still count as one.
See the [Batching Commands](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#batching-commands) section for further information.

### Maximum Sync Commands

The maximum number of commands is 100 per request. This restriction is applied to prevent
timeouts and other problems when dealing with large requests.

| todoist://projects?workspaceId={id} | Opens the projects view for the given workspace ID. | 9.10.0 |
| todoist://templates | Opens the templates view. | 9.10.0 |
| todoist://templates?id={id} | Opens the template view for the given template ID. | 9.10.0 |

### Tasks

> Example of adding a task:

_Note that this will not add the task but open the Global Quick Add refilled with given values._

```text
todoist://openquickadd?content=mytask&description=%20is%20a%20description

```

The following schemes are available for tasks:

| Scheme | Description |
| --- | --- |
| todoist://task?id={id} | Opens a task by ID. |
| todoist://openquickadd | Opens the global quick add to add a new task to Todoist. |

The `todoist://openquickadd` scheme accepts the following optional values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| content _URL encoding_ | The content of the task, which should be a string that is in `Percent-encoding` (also known as URL encoding). |
| description _URL encoding_ | The content of the task, which should be a string that is in `Percent-encoding` (also known as URL encoding). |

This URL scheme will not automatically submit the task to Todoist, it will just open and pre-fill the global quick add panel. If no values are passed, the global quick add will just be open.

### Projects

The following schemes are available for projects:

| Scheme | Description |
| --- | --- |
| todoist://project?id={id} | Opens a specific project by ID. |

> Example of opening a specific project:

```text
todoist://project?id=128501470

```

The `todoist://project` scheme accepts the following required value:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| id _Integer_ | The ID of the project to view. If the ID doesn't exist it will just open Todoist. If you don't have access to the project, or the project does not exist, an error message will be shown to the user. |

## [tag/Migrating-from-v9](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Migrating-from-v9) Migrating from v9

The Todoist API v1 is a new API that unifies the Sync API v9 and the REST API
v2. This section shows what was changed in the new version in one single
place to ease the migration for current apps and integrations.

The documentation for the [Sync API v9](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v9)
and [REST API v2](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2) are still available
for reference.

## [tag/Migrating-from-v9/General-changes](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Migrating-from-v9/General-changes) General changes

## [tag/Migrating-from-v9/General-changes/IDs](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Migrating-from-v9/General-changes/IDs) IDs

Since 2023, our objects returned `v2_*_id` attributes. That "v2 id" has now become the main `id`.

IDs have been opaque strings almost everywhere since the release of Sync API v9,
but were still mostly numbers in that version. This version officially makes
them non-number opaque strings, changing the old IDs.

The `v2_*_id` attribute is still available on Sync API v9, but was removed on the new version.
We suggest relying on them for migrating stored or cached data before bumping the major version.

You can also rely on the following endpoint to translate between both ID versions:
[`/api/v1/ids_mapping/<object>/<id>[,<id>]`](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#tag/Ids/operation/id_mappings_api_v1_id_mappings__obj_name___obj_ids__get).
It supports up to 100 IDs (of the same object) at a time.

Old IDs will NOT be accepted in this new API version for the following objects:

- notes / comments
- items / tasks
- projects
- sections
- notifications / reminders
- notifications\_locations / location\_reminder

Trying to use old IDs will result in an error.

## [tag/Migrating-from-v9/General-changes/Lowercase-endpoints](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Migrating-from-v9/General-changes/Lowercase-endpoints) Lowercase endpoints

Up until now, Todoist's endpoints were case-insensitive. The Todoist API v1
will make endpoints default to lowercase (mostly snake\_case) and reject mixed casing.

As an example:

[https://api.todoist.com/API/v9/Sync](https://api.todoist.com/API/v9/Sync)

would before be accepted in the same way as:

[https://api.todoist.com/api/v9/sync](https://api.todoist.com/api/v9/sync)

but now, the former will return 404.

Please confirm you're only issuing requests to lowercase endpoints.

## [tag/Migrating-from-v9/General-changes/Pagination](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Migrating-from-v9/General-changes/Pagination) Pagination

This version adds pagination to many endpoints.

The following endpoints are now paginated:

- `/api/v1/tasks`
- `/api/v1/labels`
- `/api/v1/labels/shared`
- `/api/v1/comments`
- `/api/v1/sections`
- `/api/v1/projects`
- `/api/v1/projects/archived`
- `/api/v1/projects/<project_id>/collaborators`
- `/api/v1/activities`

They all use [cursor-based pagination](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1#section/Developing-with-Todoist/Pagination).

## [tag/Migrating-from-v9/Previous-REST-API-endpoints-error-responses](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Migrating-from-v9/Previous-REST-API-endpoints-error-responses) Previous REST API endpoints error responses

All endpoints related to `/tasks`, `/comments`, `/sections`, `/projects`, and
`/labels` were returning `plain/text` error responses before the Todoist API v1.
With the unification of the APIs, we now unified the error response to return
`application/json` on these endpoints.

Instead of:

```
Content-type: plain/text
Task not found

```

It will return:

```json
Content-type: application/json
{
  'error': 'Task not found',
  'error_code': 478,
  'error_extra': {'event_id': '<hash>', 'retry_after': 3},
  'error_tag': 'NOT_FOUND',
  'http_code': 404
}

```

This is the same format used in the previous Sync API, which is now the default for the whole Todoist API.

## [tag/Migrating-from-v9/Object-renames](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Migrating-from-v9/Object-renames) Object renames

The API kept the old names of objects for a long time to avoid breaking
compatibility, but the unification of APIs was the perfect time to unformize.

The Todoist API v1 renames objects to match what users currently see in the app:

| Sync v9 / REST v2 | Todoist API v1 |
| --- | --- |
| items | tasks |
| notes | comments |
| notifications | reminders |
| notifications\_locations | location\_reminders |

Anywhere you see the concepts on the left, they should be renamed to the
concepts on the right, unless it's a documented exception.

The only exceptions for the renames are the `/sync` and `/activities` endpoints. They are currently scheduled for bigger architectural refactoring in the near future, so we kept the old naming for now, and will rename in the next version.

## [tag/Migrating-from-v9/URL-renames](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Migrating-from-v9/URL-renames) URL renames

With the unification of both API, we took the chance to unify concepts and improve some old time URLs to new standards. These are the endpoint signature changes:

## [tag/Migrating-from-v9/Deprecated-endpoints](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Migrating-from-v9/Deprecated-endpoints) Deprecated endpoints

There are some endpoints that were previously available in the Sync or REST
APIs, but were removed from the Todoist API v1. Below is a list of them and
possible candidates for replacement:

| Sync v9 / REST v2 | New endpoint taking its place |
| --- | --- |
| `/sync/v9/archive/items_many` | `/api/v1/tasks/completed/by_completion_date` |
| `/sync/v9/archive/items` | `/api/v1/tasks/completed/by_completion_date` |
| `/sync/v9/completed/get_all` | `/api/v1/tasks/completed/by_completion_date` |
| `/sync/v9/projects/get` | `/api/v1/projects`, `/api/v1/comment` |
| `/sync/v9/items/get` | `/api/v1/tasks`, `/api/v1/comments`, `/api/v1/projects`, `/api/v1/sections` |
| `/sync/v9/projects/get_data` | `/api/v1/tasks`, `/api/v1/comments`, `/api/v1/projects`, `/api/v1/sections` |

## [tag/Migrating-from-v9/Other-endpoints/sections](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Migrating-from-v9/Other-endpoints/sections)/sections

Sections used a slightly different response formats in the Sync and REST APIs.
The Todoist API v1 uses the format previously used by the Sync API everywhere.

## [tag/Migrating-from-v9/Other-endpoints/comments](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1\#tag/Migrating-from-v9/Other-endpoints/comments)/comments
